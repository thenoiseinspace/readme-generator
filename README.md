# readme-generator

## Description

This project generates professional-grade README files using Node. It was built to make it easier for developers to generate quality READMEs using only the command line, without having to open .md documents. It has also been a great way for me to master the basics of Node.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
